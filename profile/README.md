‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:**
This project was created using "vibe coding"‚Äîan AI-dependent, improvisational approach where software is produced by describing problems in natural language to a large language model (LLM). Vibe coding, as originally coined by Andrej Karpathy, means fully embracing the AI's suggestions, often without reviewing or understanding the code it generates. This is distinct from responsible AI-assisted programming, where code is reviewed, tested, and understood before use.

Vibe coding is best suited for low-stakes, experimental, or personal projects where rapid prototyping is more important than code quality, security, or maintainability. The resulting codebase may not follow best practices, may contain bugs or vulnerabilities, and could change frequently. Do not use this approach for production or sensitive applications. Use with caution!
